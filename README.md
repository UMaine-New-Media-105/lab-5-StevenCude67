EX One

In EX One I had to create a srpite that would bounce back and forth on every side of the screen. 
I did this by changing the speed by -1 when it hit the sides or tops. I also made the speedX and speedY random between 5 and 10 so
thier was alwats variation. This created a screensaver type of animation.

EX Two

In EX Two I took the previous assignment and allowed the arrow keys to infulence the direction of the sprite. I did this by using the KeyPressed funtion 
and If and Else-If code. When I put in all the code, when I pressed UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, the direction changed for each respective key I hit. I 
decided to make the speed random like in EX One. I had a bit of trouble getting the keyPresed to work, but I eventiually figurd it out.
